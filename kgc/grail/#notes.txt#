;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.


Ideas:

Evaluators:
- variation in number of secrets which see change AND ID of secrets which se change
  - NBF most consistent
  - RuleN largest number

- RuleN issues as evaluator (done-ish)

Nominators:
	- Grail best RuleN
	- RN best GR, BF
	  - here point out KGC perf !=
