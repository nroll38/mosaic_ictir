problem + mosaicing

modeled as:
  1) public graph
  2) set of secrets
  3) review set

task: determine which relation in graph most substantially increases risk of inference

experiments w/3 kgcs using fb1k demonstrate capabil and limit of this approach to modeling task
--------------------------------------



TODO:
	- graphics updates: have better resolution, etc.
	   - low priority
	- Add performance, rank change statistics?

	   - BLUF: Bad model, always able interdict self but effictively random guess -> hard to interdict
	  
	   - Also - very resilient model, low average change (removals have minor impact)

	 - future works -> LLM
	 
	 - finish 150 secret runs

	 - full paper review + updates
